 # Using GitHub Actions to get webcams info

This repository contains images captured from a webcam located at Camping de Pineta in Espierba Casart, in the beautiful Pyrenees.

This repository was created as a playground to experiment with GitHub Actions for automating the process of obtaining webcam images, saving them, uploading them to the repository, and then creating a video from these images.

## Features

- Automated Image Capture: Using GitHub Actions, the webcam images are periodically captured and saved.
- Image Upload: The captured images are automatically uploaded to this repository.

## GitHub Actions Workflow
The repository contains GitHub Actions workflows defined in the .github/workflows directory. These workflows handle:

- Fetching images from the webcam at regular intervals.
- Committing and pushing these images to the repository.

## Acknowledgements

- Inspired by the stunning scenery of the Pyrenees and the desire to automate the capture of its beauty.
- Special thanks to the maintainers of the webcam at Camping de Pineta.
